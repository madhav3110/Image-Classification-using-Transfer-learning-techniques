# Image-Classification-using-Transfer-learning-techniques
This project's goal is to perform image classification task on famous personalities image dataset and perform comparative analysis between pre-defined CNN architectures such as VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet201,MobileNetV2 and ResNet50V2 to find the cnn architecture that gives more accuracy for our problem statement.
